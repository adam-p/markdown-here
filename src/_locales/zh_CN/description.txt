Markdown Here允许你在发送电子邮件之前用Markdown语法编辑并转换它(让它看起来漂亮极了!)。

这对于那些不喜欢在撰写电邮时反复摆弄排版按钮的人无疑是好消息。 它特别适合那些要在电子邮件中插入代码的程序员们 —— 没错，它甚至支持语法高亮显示。 对于我们之中的数学家们而言，Markdown Here也支持转换TeX公式。

使用起来十分简易：
1. 在你的电子邮箱客户端的富文本编辑栏(rich editor)中使用Github支持的Markdown。
2. Right-click in the compose area and then click "Markdown Toggle".
3. Your email is now pretty! (That is, it's been rendered to HTML.)
4. If you like the way it looks, just send it. If you want to change or add something, click "Markdown Toggle" again to get back to your original Markdown.
5. Repeat as necessary.

Markdown Here is primarily targeted to work with Gmail and Thunderbird, but it also works pretty well with Yahoo and Hotmail. Additionally, it works great with Google Groups and Sites, Evernote's web interface, Blogger, Wordpress, and more!

Syntax highlighting note: Use fenced code blocks and specify the language name. See the project page for an example.

Privacy: Markdown Here accesses and modifies web content when you activate it. It can, in theory, access other web content, but does not. It also makes no Internet requests whatsoever. Your data is modified when and where you choose, and does not leave your browser.

Available as a Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Thunderbird extension.

This is an open source project. Visit Markdown Here's Github page for full instructions, more information, bug reports, or to contribute.
