# Privacy Policy

The _Markdown Here_ browser extension strictly does one thing: Allows users to convert Markdown to HTML inside a rich edit control. Not one thing else.

This means that:
- It collects no user or usage data.
- It does not read or modify any part of any site besides the contents of the focused edit control, and only when the user tells it to do so.

## What data is shared?

- Markdown Here uses the third-party [CodeCogs](https://codecogs.com/) to render math equations. When you render markdown that contains mathematical equations, Markdown Here sends the mathematical portion of your markdown to CodeCogs for rendering.
