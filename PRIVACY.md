The _Markdown Here_ browser extension strictly does one thing: Allows users to convert Markdown to HTML inside a rich edit control. Not one thing else.

This means that:
- It collects no user or usage data.
- It does not read or modify any part of any site besides the contents of the focused edit control, and only when the user tells it to do so.
- It makes no external requests at all. All rendering is done locally.
